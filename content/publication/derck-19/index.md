abstract: 'Large amounts of unlabelled data are commonplace for many applications
  in computational pathology, whereas labelled data is often expensive, both in time
  and cost, to acquire. We investigate the performance of unsupervised and supervised
  deep learning methods when few labelled data are available. Three methods are compared:
  clustering autoencoder latent vectors (unsupervised), a single layer classifier
  combined with a pre-trained autoencoder (semi-supervised), and a supervised CNN.
  We apply these methods on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained prostatectomy images
  to classify tumour versus non-tumour tissue. Results show that semi-/unsupervised
  methods have an advantage over supervised learning when few labels are available.
  Additionally, we show that incorporating immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained data
  provides an increase in performance over only using H&E.'
