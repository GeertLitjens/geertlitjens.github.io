abstract: 'Deep learning algorithms, in particular convolutional networks, have rapidly
  become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. This paper reviews
  the major deep learning concepts pertinent to medical image analysis and summarizes
  over 300 contributions to the field, most of which appeared in the last year. We
  survey the use of deep learning for image classification, object detection, segmentation,
  registration, and other tasks. Concise overviews are provided of studies per application
  area: neuro, retinal, pulmonary, digital pathology, breast, cardiac, abdominal,
  musculoskeletal. We end with a summary of the current state-of-the-art, a critical
  discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.'
