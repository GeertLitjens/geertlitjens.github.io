abstract: MR to TRUS guided biopsies can be a cost-effective solution for prostate
  biopsies. Prostate cancer can be detected on MRI and a biopsy can be directed towards
  a suspicious region. With the help of an accurate MR-US registration method the
  tumor can also be targeted under transrectal US guidance. For heterogeneous tumors,
  the needle should be guided towards the most aggressive part of the tumor. Not the
  tumor size, but the size of this smaller tumor hotspot determines the required accuracy
  of the registration. We investigate the percentage of tumors that are heterogeneous
  and the corresponding hotspot volume. Results show a hotspot in 63% of the tumors,
  with a median volume of 0.3 cm3. By assuming a spherical shape, the required accuracy
  can be determined. For a 90% tumor hit-rate, the registration error should be less
  than 2.87 mm.
