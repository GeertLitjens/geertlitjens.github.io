abstract: Tissue segmentation is an important pre-requisite for efficient and accurate
  diagnostics in digital pathology. However, it is well known that whole-slide scanners
  can fail in detecting all tissue regions, for example due to the tissue type, or
  due to weak staining because their tissue detection algorithms are not robust enough.
  In this paper, we introduce two different convolutional neural network architectures
  for whole slide image segmentation to accurately identify the tissue sections. We
  also compare the algorithms to a published traditional method. We collected 54 whole
  slide images with differing stains and tissue types from three laboratories to validate
  our algorithms. We show that while the two methods do not differ significantly they
  outperform their traditional counterpart (Jaccard index of 0.937 and 0.929 vs. 0.870,
  p < 0.01).
