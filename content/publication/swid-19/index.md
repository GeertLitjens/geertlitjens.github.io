abstract: 'The immune system is of critical importance in the development of cancer.
  The evasion of destruction by the immune system is one of the emerging hallmarks
  of cancer. We have built a dataset of 171,166 manually annotated CD3  and CD8  cells,
  which we used to train deep learning algorithms for automatic detection of lymphocytes
  in histopathology images to better quantify immune response. Moreover, we investigate
  the effectiveness of four deep learning based methods when different subcompartments
  of the whole-slide image are considered: normal tissue areas, areas with immune
  cell clusters, and areas containing artifacts. We have compared the proposed methods
  in breast, colon and prostate cancer tissue slides collected from nine different
  medical centers. Finally, we report the results of an observer study on lymphocyte
  quantification, which involved four pathologists from different medical centers,
  and compare their performance with the automatic detection. The results give insights
  on the applicability of the proposed methods for clinical use. U-Net obtained the
  highest performance with an F1-score of 0.78 and the highest agreement with manual
  evaluation (κ=0.72), whereas the average pathologists agreement with reference standard
  was κ=0.64. The test set and the automatic evaluation procedure are publicly available
  at lyon19.grand-challenge.org.'
