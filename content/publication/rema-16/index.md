abstract: Despite remarkable recent achievements of immunotherapy strategies in cancer
  treatment, clinical responses remain limited to subsets of patients. Predictive
  markers of disease course and response to immunotherapy are urgently needed. Recent
  results have revealed the potential predictive value of immune cell phenotype and
  spatial distribution at the tumor site, prompting the need for multidimensional
  immunohistochemical analyses of tumor tissues. To address this need, we developed
  a sample-sparing, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique based on iterative
  cycles of tagging, image scanning, and destaining of chromogenic substrate on a
  single slide. This assay, in combination with a newly developed automated digital
  landscaping solution, democratizes access to high-dimensional immunohistochemical
  analyses by capturing the complexity of the immunome using routine pathology standards.
  Applications of the method extend beyond cancer to screen and validate comprehensive
  panels of tissue-based prognostic and predictive markers, perform indepth in situ
  monitoring of therapies, and identify targets of disease.
