abstract: The anatomical location of imaging features is of crucial importance for
  accurate diagnosis in many medical tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have
  had huge successes in computer vision, but they lack the natural ability to incorporate
  the anatomical location in their decision making process, hindering success in some
  medical image analysis tasks. In this paper, to integrate the anatomical location
  information into the network, we propose several deep CNN architectures that consider
  multi-scale patches or take explicit location features while training. We apply
  and compare the proposed architectures for segmentation of white matter hyperintensities
  in brain MR images on a large dataset. As a result, we observe that the CNNs that
  incorporate location information substantially outperform a conventional segmentation
  method with handcrafted features as well as CNNs that do not integrate location
  information. On a test set of 50 scans, the best configuration of our networks obtained
  a Dice score of 0.792, compared to 0.805 for an independent human observer. Performance
  levels of the machine and the independent human observer were not statistically
  significantly different (p-value = 0.06).
