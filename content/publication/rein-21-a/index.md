abstract: While the importance of automatic image analysis is increasing at an enormous
  pace, recent meta-research revealed major flaws with respect to algorithm validation.
  Specifically, performance metrics are key for objective, transparent and comparative
  performance assessment, but relatively little attention has been given to the practical
  pitfalls when using specific metrics for a given image analysis task. A common mission
  of several international initiatives is therefore to provide researchers with guidelines
  and tools to choose the performance metrics in a problem-aware manner. This dynamically
  updated document has the purpose to illustrate important limitations of performance
  metrics commonly applied in the field of image analysis. The current version is
  based on a Delphi process on metrics conducted by an international consortium of
  image analysis experts.
