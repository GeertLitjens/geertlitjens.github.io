abstract: 'Semantic segmentation of medical images aims to associate a pixel with
  a label in a medical image without human initialization. The success of semantic
  segmentation algorithms is contingent on the availability of high-quality imaging
  data with corresponding labels provided by experts. We sought to create a large
  collection of annotated medical image datasets of various clinically relevant anatomies
  available under open source license to facilitate the development of semantic segmentation
  algorithms. Such a resource would allow: 1) objective assessment of general-purpose
  segmentation methods through comprehensive benchmarking and 2) open and free access
  to medical image data for any researcher interested in the problem domain. Through
  a multi-institutional effort, we generated a large, curated dataset representative
  of several highly variable segmentation tasks that was used in a crowd-sourced challenge
  - the Medical Segmentation Decathlon held during the 2018 Medical Image Computing
  and Computer Aided Interventions Conference in Granada, Spain. Here, we describe
  these ten labeled image datasets so that these data may be effectively reused by
  the research community.'
