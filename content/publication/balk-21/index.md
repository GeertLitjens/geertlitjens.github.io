abstract: The tumour microenvironment has been shown to be a valuable source of prognostic
  information for different cancer types. This holds in particular for triple negative
  breast cancer (TNBC), a breast cancer subtype for which currently no prognostic
  biomarkers are established. Although different methods to assess tumour infiltrating
  lymphocytes (TILs) have been published, it remains unclear which method (marker,
  region) yields the most optimal prognostic information. In addition, to date, no
  objective TILs assessment methods are available. For this proof of concept study,
  a subset of our previously described TNBC cohort (n = 94) was stained for CD3, CD8
  and FOXP3 using multiplex immunohistochemistry and subsequently imaged by a multispectral
  imaging system. Advanced whole-slide image analysis algorithms, including convolutional
  neural networks (CNN) were used to register unmixed multispectral images and corresponding
  H&E sections, to segment the different tissue compartments (tumour, stroma) and
  to detect all individual positive lymphocytes. Densities of positive lymphocytes
  were analysed in different regions within the tumour and its neighbouring environment
  and correlated to relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We found
  that for all TILs markers the presence of a high density of positive cells correlated
  with an improved survival. None of the TILs markers was superior to the others.
  The results of TILs assessment in the various regions did not show marked differences
  between each other. The negative correlation between TILs and survival in our cohort
  are in line with previous studies. Our results provide directions for optimizing
  TILs assessment methodology.
