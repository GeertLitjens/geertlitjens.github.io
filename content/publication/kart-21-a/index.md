abstract: 'Diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer in biopsies are critical
  for the clinical management of men with prostate cancer. Despite this, the high
  grading variability among pathologists leads to the potential for under- and overtreatment.
  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have shown promise in assisting pathologists
  to perform Gleason grading, which could help address this problem. In this mini-review,
  we highlight studies reporting on the development of AI systems for cancer detection
  and Gleason grading, and discuss the progress needed for widespread clinical implementation,
  as well as anticipated future developments. PATIENT SUMMARY: This mini-review summarizes
  the evidence relating to the validation of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted
  cancer detection and Gleason grading of prostate cancer in biopsies, and highlights
  the remaining steps required prior to its widespread clinical implementation. We
  found that, although there is strong evidence to show that AI is able to perform
  Gleason grading on par with experienced uropathologists, more work is needed to
  ensure the accuracy of results from AI systems in diverse settings across different
  patient populations, digitization platforms, and pathology laboratories.'
