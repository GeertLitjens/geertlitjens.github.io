abstract: 'Zonal segmentation of the prostate into the central gland and peripheral
  zone is a useful tool in computer-aided detection of prostate cancer, because occurrence
  and characteristics of cancer in both zones differ substantially. In this paper
  we present a pattern recognition approach to segment the prostate zones. It incorporates
  three types of features that can differentiate between the two zones: anatomical,
  intensity and texture. It is evaluated against a multi-parametric multi-atlas based
  method using 48 multi-parametric MRI studies. Three observers are used to assess
  inter-observer variability and we compare our results against the state of the art
  from literature. Results show a mean Dice coefficient of 0.89 +/- 0.03 for the central
  gland and 0.75 +/- 0.07 for the peripheral zone, compared to 0.87 +/-0.04 and 0.76
  +/- 0.06 in literature. Summarizing, a pattern recognition approach incorporating
  anatomy, intensity and texture has been shown to give good results in zonal segmentation
  of the prostate.'
