abstract: Pathologists face a substantial increase in workload and complexity of histopathologic
  cancer diagnosis due to the advent of personalized medicine. Therefore, diagnostic
  protocols have to focus equally on efficiency and accuracy. In this paper we introduce
  'deep learning' as a technique to improve the objectivity and efficiency of histopathologic
  slide analysis. Through two examples, prostate cancer identification in biopsy specimens
  and breast cancer metastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes, we show the potential
  of this new methodology to reduce the workload for pathologists, while at the same
  time increasing objectivity of diagnoses. We found that all slides containing prostate
  cancer and micro- and macro-metastases of breast cancer could be identified automatically
  while 30-40% of the slides containing benign and normal tissue could be excluded
  without the use of any additional immunohistochemical markers or human intervention.
  We conclude that 'deep learning' holds great promise to improve the efficacy of
  prostate cancer diagnosis and breast cancer staging.
