abstract: We propose an unsupervised method using self-clustering convolutional adversarial
  autoencoders to classify prostate tissue as tumor or non-tumor without any labeled
  training data. The clustering method is integrated into the training of the autoencoder
  and requires only little post-processing. Our network trains on hematoxylin and
  eosin (H&E) input patches and we tested two different reconstruction targets, H&E
  and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We show that antibody-driven feature learning using
  IHC helps the network to learn relevant features for the clustering task. Our network
  achieves a F1 score of 0.62 using only a small set of validation labels to assign
  classes to clusters.
