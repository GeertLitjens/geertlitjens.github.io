abstract: One in 10 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their life.
  PSA screening in combination with MR is likely to save lifes at low biopsy and overtreatment
  rates. Computer Aided Diagnosis for prostate MR will become mandatory in a high
  volume screening application. This paper presents an overview including our recent
  work in this area. It includes screening MR setup, quantitative imaging features,
  prostate segmentation, and pattern recognition.
