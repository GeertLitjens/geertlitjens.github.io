abstract: 'International challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative
  assessment of image analysis algorithms given a specific task. Segmentation is so
  far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the various
  segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation, such that algorithm
  development was driven by the need to tackle a single specific clinical problem.
  We hypothesized that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will
  generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed
  solution. To investigate the hypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon
  (MSD) - a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a
  multitude of both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to
  explore the axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical
  images, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small objects.
  The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good performance on
  a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a different set of previously
  unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD winner for two years, we found that
  this algorithm continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems,
  further confirming our hypothesis. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this
  study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are mature, accurate,
  and generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance
  across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3)
  the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI experts.'
