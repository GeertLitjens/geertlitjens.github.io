abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for automatic detection of regions of
  interest in whole slide histopathological images. The proposed algorithm generates
  and classifies superpixels at multiple resolutions to detect regions of interest.
  The algorithm emulates the way the pathologist examines the whole slide histopathology
  image by processing the image at low magnifications and performing more sophisticated
  analysis only on areas requiring more detailed information. However, instead of
  the traditional usage of fixed sized rectangular patches for the identification
  of relevant areas, we use superpixels as the visual primitives to detect regions
  of interest. Rectangular patches can span multiple distinct structures, thus degrade
  the classification performance. The proposed multi-scale superpixel classification
  approach yields superior performance for the identification of the regions of interest.
  For the evaluation, a set of 10 whole slide histopathology images of breast tissue
  were used. Empirical evaluation of the performance of our proposed algorithm relative
  to expert manual annotations shows that the algorithm achieves an area under the
  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.958, demonstrating its efficacy
  for the detection of regions of interest.
