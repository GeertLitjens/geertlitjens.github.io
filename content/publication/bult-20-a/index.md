abstract: The Gleason score is the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer
  patients, but it suffers from significant observer variability. Artificial intelligence
  (AI) systems based on deep learning can achieve pathologist-level performance at
  Gleason grading. However, the performance of such systems can degrade in the presence
  of artifacts, foreign tissue, or other anomalies. Pathologists integrating their
  expertise with feedback from an AI system could result in a synergy that outperforms
  both the individual pathologist and the system. Despite the hype around AI assistance,
  existing literature on this topic within the pathology domain is limited. We investigated
  the value of AI assistance for grading prostate biopsies. A panel of 14 observers
  graded 160 biopsies with and without AI assistance. Using AI, the agreement of the
  panel with an expert reference standard increased significantly (quadratically weighted
  Cohen's kappa, 0.799 vs. 0.872; p = 0.019). On an external validation set of 87
  cases, the panel showed a significant increase in agreement with a panel of international
  experts in prostate pathology (quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa, 0.733 vs. 0.786;
  p = 0.003). In both experiments, on a group-level, AI-assisted pathologists outperformed
  the unassisted pathologists and the standalone AI system. Our results show the potential
  of AI systems for Gleason grading, but more importantly, show the benefits of pathologist-AI
  synergy.
