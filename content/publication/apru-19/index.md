abstract: Recent years have seen a growing awareness of the role the immune system
  plays in successful cancer treatment, especially in novel therapies like immunotherapy.
  The characterization of the immunological composition of tumors and their micro-environment
  is thus becoming a necessity. In this paper we introduce a deep learning-based immune
  cell detection and quantification method, which is based on supervised learning,
  i.e., the input data for training comprises labeled images. Our approach objectively
  deals with staining variation and staining artifacts in immunohistochemically stained
  lung cancer tissue and is as precise as humans. This is evidenced by the low cell
  count difference to humans of 0.033 cells on average. This method, which is based
  on convolutional neural networks, has the potential to provide a new quantitative
  basis for research on immunotherapy.
