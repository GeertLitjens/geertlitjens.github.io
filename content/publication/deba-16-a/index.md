abstract: The key to MR lymphography is suppression of T2* MR signal in normal lymph
  nodes, while retaining high signal in metastatic nodes. Our objective is to quantitatively
  compare the ability of ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol to suppress the MR signal
  in normal pelvic lymph nodes. In 2010, a set of consecutive patients who underwent
  intravenous MR Lymphography (MRL) were included. Signal suppression in normal lymph
  nodes in T2*-weighted images due to uptake of USPIO (Ultra-Small Superparamagnetic
  Particles of Iron Oxide) was quantified. Signal suppression by two USPIO contrast
  agents, ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol was compared using Wilcoxon's signed rank
  test. Forty-four patients were included, of which all 44 had a ferumoxtran-10 MRL
  and 4 had additionally a ferumoxytol MRL. A total of 684 lymph nodes were identified
  in the images, of which 174 had been diagnosed as metastatic. USPIO-induced signal
  suppression in normal lymph nodes was significantly stronger in ferumoxtran-10 MRL
  than in ferumoxytol MRL (p < 0.005). T2* signal suppression in normal pelvic lymph
  nodes is significantly stronger with ferumoxtran-10 than with ferumoxytol, which
  may affect diagnostic accuracy.
