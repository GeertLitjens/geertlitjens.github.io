abstract: 'Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have boosted the interest in the
  role played by the immune system in cancer treatment. In particular, the presence
  of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have become a central research topic in
  oncology and pathology. Consequently, a method to automatically detect and quantify
  immune cells is of great interest. In this paper, we present a comparison of different
  deep learning (DL) techniques for the detection of lymphocytes in immunohistochemically
  stained (CD3 and CD8) slides of breast, prostate and colon cancer. The compared
  methods cover the state-of-the-art in object localization, classification and segmentation:
  Locality Sensitive Method (LSM), U-net, You Only Look Once (YOLO) and fully-convolutional
  networks (FCNN). A dataset with 109,841 annotated cells from 58 whole-slide images
  was used for this study. Overall, U-net and YOLO achieved the highest results, with
  an F1-score of 0.78 in regular tissue areas. U-net approach was more robust to biological
  and staining variability and could also handle staining and tissue artifacts.'
