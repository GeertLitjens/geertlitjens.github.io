abstract: 'Five years after the last prostatic carcinoma grading consensus conference
  of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP), accrual of new data
  and modification of clinical practice require an update of current pathologic grading
  guidelines. This manuscript summarizes the proceedings of the ISUP consensus meeting
  for grading of prostatic carcinoma held in September 2019, in Nice, France. Topics
  brought to consensus included the following: (1) approaches to reporting of Gleason
  patterns 4 and 5 quantities, and minor/tertiary patterns, (2) an agreement to report
  the presence of invasive cribriform carcinoma, (3) an agreement to incorporate intraductal
  carcinoma into grading, and (4) individual versus aggregate grading of systematic
  and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsies. Finally, developments
  in the field of artificial intelligence in the grading of prostatic carcinoma and
  future research perspectives were discussed.'
