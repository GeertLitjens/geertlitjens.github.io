abstract: The development of reliable imaging biomarkers for the analysis of colorectal
  cancer (CRC) in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathology images requires
  an accurate and reproducible classification of the main tissue components in the
  image. In this paper, we propose a system for CRC tissue classification based on
  convolutional networks (ConvNets). We investigate the importance of stain normalization
  in tissue classification of CRC tissue samples in H&E-stained images. Furthermore,
  we report the performance of ConvNets on a cohort of rectal cancer samples and on
  an independent publicly available dataset of colorectal H&E images.
