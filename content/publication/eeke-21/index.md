abstract: Cellularity estimation forms an important aspect of the visual examination
  of bone marrow biopsies. In clinical practice, cellularity is estimated by eye under
  a microscope, which is rapid, but subjective and subject to inter- and intraobserver
  variability. In addition, there is little consensus in the literature on the normal
  variation of cellularity with age. Digital image analysis may be used for more objective
  quantification of cellularity. As such, we developed a deep neural network for the
  segmentation of six major cell and tissue types in digitized bone marrow trephine
  biopsies. Using this segmentation, we calculated the overall bone marrow cellularity
  in a series of biopsies from 130 patients across a wide age range. Using intraclass
  correlation coefficients (ICC), we measured the agreement between the quantification
  by the neural network and visual estimation by two pathologists and compared it
  to baseline human performance. We also examined the age-related changes of cellularity
  and cell lineages in bone marrow and compared our results to those found in the
  literature. The network was capable of accurate segmentation (average accuracy and
  dice score of 0.95 and 0.76, respectively). There was good neural network-pathologist
  agreement on cellularity measurements (ICC=0.78, 95% CI 0.58-0.85). We found a statistically
  significant downward trend for cellularity, myelopoiesis and megakaryocytes with
  age in our cohort. The mean cellularity began at approximately 50% in the third
  decade of life and then decreased Â±2% per decade to 40% in the seventh and eighth
  decade, but the normal range was very wide (30-70%).
