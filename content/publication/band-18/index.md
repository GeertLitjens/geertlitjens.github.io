abstract: Automated detection of cancer metastases in lymph nodes has the potential
  to improve assessment of prognosis for patients. To enable fair comparison between
  the algorithms for this purpose, we set up the CAMELYON17 challenge in conjunction
  with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 conference in Melbourne.
  Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted
  a total of 37 algorithms before the initial deadline. Participants were provided
  with 899 whole-slide images for developing their algorithms.The developed algorithms
  were evaluated based on the test set encompassing 100 patients and 500 whole-slide
  images. The evaluation metric used was a quadratic weighted Cohentextquoterights
  kappa. We discuss the algorithmic details of the ten best preconference and two
  post-conference submissions. All these participants used convolutional neural networks
  in combination with pre- and postprocessing steps. Algorithms differed mostly in
  neural network architecture, training strategy and pre- and postprocessing methodology.
  Overall, the kappa metric ranged from 0.89 to -0.13 across all submissions. The
  best results were obtained with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet. Confusion
  matrix analysis revealed that all participants struggled with reliably identifying
  isolated tumor cells, the smallest type of metastasis, with detection rates below
  40%. Qualitative inspection of the results of the top participants showed categories
  of false positives, such as nerves or contamination, which could be targets for
  further optimization. Last, we show that simple combinations of the top algorithms
  result in higher kappa metric values than any algorithm individually, with 0.93
  for the best combination.
