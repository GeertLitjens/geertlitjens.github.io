abstract: The aims of this study were to assess the discriminative performance of
  quantitative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) between prostate
  cancer and noncancer tissues and between tumor grade groups (GGs) in a multicenter,
  single-vendor study, and to investigate to what extent site-specific differences
  affect variations in mpMRI parameters. Fifty patients with biopsy-proven prostate
  cancer from 5 institutions underwent a standardized preoperative mpMRI protocol.
  Based on the evaluation of whole-mount histopathology sections, regions of interest
  were placed on axial T2-weighed MRI scans in cancer and noncancer peripheral zone
  (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) tissue. Regions of interest were transferred to functional
  parameter maps, and quantitative parameters were extracted. Across-center variations
  in noncancer tissues, differences between tissues, and the relation to cancer grade
  groups were assessed using linear mixed-effects models and receiver operating characteristic
  analyses. Variations in quantitative parameters were low across institutes (mean
  [maximum] proportion of total variance in PZ and TZ, 4% [14%] and 8% [46%], respectively).
  Cancer and noncancer tissues were best separated using the diffusion-weighted imaging-derived
  apparent diffusion coefficient, both in PZ and TZ (mean [95% confidence interval]
  areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUCs]; 0.93 [0.89-0.96]
  and 0.86 [0.75-0.94]), followed by MR spectroscopic imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced-derived
  parameters. Parameters from all imaging methods correlated significantly with tumor
  grade group in PZ tumors. In discriminating GG1 PZ tumors from higher GGs, the highest
  AUC was obtained with apparent diffusion coefficient (0.74 [0.57-0.90], P < 0.001).
  The best separation of GG1-2 from GG3-5 PZ tumors was with a logistic regression
  model of a combination of functional parameters (mean AUC, 0.89 [0.78-0.98]). Standardized
  data acquisition and postprocessing protocols in prostate mpMRI at 3 T produce equivalent
  quantitative results across patients from multiple institutions and achieve similar
  discrimination between cancer and noncancer tissues and cancer grade groups as in
  previously reported single-center studies.This is an open-access article distributed
