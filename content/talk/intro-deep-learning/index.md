This presentation was the first part of a half-a-day workshop on deep learning in medical imaging. It introduces the basic deep learning concepts, contrasts them to more traditional pattern recognition approaches, and shows some examples from the field. If you are interested in a more thorough overview of different applications, I can recommend [this]({{< ref "/publication/litj-17/index.md" >}}) publication.
